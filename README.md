<h1> ðŸ‘‹ Hi everyone welcome to my GitHub! </h1>

My name is Alex and I'm a recent graduate of General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive- a full time 450+ hour program teaching a variety of languages and 
technical libraries. Here's a little bit about me below:


Big video game nerd- tell me what you've been playing lately!
Majorly into sports, meteorology, and history
Love animals and am a proud dog dad of Copper, a precious rescue mutt

I'm strongest in CSS (Tailwind, ReactBootstrap as well) and am always branching out to discover more things.
Studied Javascript (React, Express, Node) the most, also versed in Python (Django) and teaching myself C#
